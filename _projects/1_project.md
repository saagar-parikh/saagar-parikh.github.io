Formulated a robust active learning framework with automation in selecting the data points to be labeled to reduce human
efforts by 90% and improve the performance of existing classification models such as DNN and XGBoost.

Analyzed billions of astronomical sources and their time-series representation of varying intensities (light curves) from the
Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) survey and used API queries and data visualization for preprocessing tasks

Active learning pipeline that selects the most impactful sources using: i. the 6 types based on the classification scores, ii. spatial cross-matching and demanding agreement between the g and r bands, iii. braai scores, and iv. amplitudes.
