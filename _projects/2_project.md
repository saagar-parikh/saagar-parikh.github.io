Contributed to an open-source Python library with a unified and transparent approach for various distribution approximation techniques such as Laplace Approximation and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling.

Reinforced the approximation methods by adding extensive functionalities such as Full rank, Low rank, Mean Field, Subnetwork, Last Layer, and Kronecker-Factored Approximate Curvature (KFAC).
