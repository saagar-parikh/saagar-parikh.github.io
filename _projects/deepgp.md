- Investigated the current state-of-the-art Gaussian Processes model and assessed the need for the inference of sparse air quality monitoring stations at the unmonitored locations in the Beijing spatio-temporal air quality dataset.
- Achieved comparable results using Deep Gaussian Processes with a simple kernel and Deep Kernel Learning methods to capture domain knowledge by extracting hierarchical features.
