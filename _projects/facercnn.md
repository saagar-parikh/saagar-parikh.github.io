- Created the Face R-CNN network from scratch in PyTorch after reviewing, analyzing, and modifying popular object detection models such as Faster R-CNN by introducing a revised loss function and a multi-scale training strategy.
- Examined prominent pre-existing deep learning neural networks such as VGG, LeNet, AlexNet, and FaceNet and learned how they materialized into a new face detection network called Face R-CNN.
